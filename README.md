Just another repository

Hello,

My Name is Aimee and ITWP-1150 is my last class for the Information Technology-Website Programming, AAS degree. I have been working while attending MCC, and sometimes it was difficult but I worked hard and got through it. I'm happy and excited to move forward in this field of work.
